* AESS : Approximate and Exact Solution Simulation

In this project i worked on how approximate and exact solution differ from each other. Approximate solution in where i took sin(t) to t, which gives linear differential equation of motion. In constrast to that Exact solution give nonlinearity. 

Look at the simple phase planes for this two,

* Extension <2022-12-25 Sun> 

I thought of extending this project for chaos dynamics. Which will give rise to new project for second semester.

Since my project is gateaway of chaos dynamics, i could make my project to follow that.

Future works,

- [ ] Research on best chaos dynamics projects

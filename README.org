* AESS : Approximate and Exact Solution Simulation

In this project i worked on how approximate and exact solution differ from each other. Approximate solution in where i took sin(t) to t, which gives linear differential equation of motion. In constrast to that Exact solution give nonlinearity.

Look at the simple phase planes for this two,

Today we present our project named as Approximations in physics. Well, it is very minor topic but it's effect are sometimes gargantuas. For example, our classical mechanics and modern physics. Kinetic energy from classics mechanics is $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ where in Reletivistic mechanics we have powerseries $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}+\frac{3}{8}mv^{4}+...$. This effect is sometimes of knowledge gap and sometimes of intentionally to easyfy our problems. We are using this type of approximation from very earlier in physics major. We approximated series expansions like it's nothing but except for sometimes it has grave consiquenses. We will be looking at this by one example, that is  what we done in this project?. From twelve standard we studied extensively on Simple harmonic oscillator with pendulum motion. But what if i say simple harmonics motion is not as simple as we studied, when we study without important approximation. That's advantages of approximation as our textbook hide non linear differential equation behind that approximation, but some draw backs are also there that  we had learnt in this project. Most importantly it's completely different system, from frequency to it's nonconservative forces if we include in it. First task in non approximated was getting solution, which we tried, we even searched online on google scholar for papers on it but no chances as we learn that there's no close form solution for it, what they done is better and better approximations, so, we tried another method, by going for numerical methods. Yes, i know that it is still approximation but it like using approximation methods in quantum mechanics. You can ofcourse rely on it. Since, it uses mathematical concept exactly with adequate numerical significance.

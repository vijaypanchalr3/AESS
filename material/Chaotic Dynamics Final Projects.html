</p><h2 align="center"> Final Projects</h2><p>
<br>


</p><h3>General Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Can take many forms -- need not be a paper.  We will discuss as 
a class whether or not we want to have a set of presentations open to
the coa community, or if we just want to present to the class.
</li><li>  Should be on some topic that's interesting to you.
</li><li> You and I share responsibility for the project.  I will try to
meet with you all individually and discuss possible projects.  But you
also need to take some initiative; if you're feeling lost or confused,
be assertive and find me sooner rather than later.
</li><li>  I strongly encourage you to work on projects in groups.  Perhaps
you'll end up doing separate projects, but maybe a few of you have
broadly similar interests.  If this is the case, I suggest doing some
common background readings and meeting to discuss as a group.

<h3>Preliminary Project Guidelines</h3>
Here are some properties of an excellent final project:
<ol>
<li>Most importantly, you should learn something in the course of
doing your project.  Ideally, you'll find one or two ideas that you'll
want to explore thoroughly.
</li><li>You should meet all deadlines.
</li><li>Whatever medium you choose -- talk, paper, etc -- your project 
should be well presented.   You should have a clear audience in mind.  
</li><li>Your project should be more than a "book" report.  You should do
something.  This might entail building something, writing or
experimenting with computer programs, or doing a bunch of problems.  
</li><li>Your project should be something you work on over several weeks.
It should not be hastily completed during week 9.
</li><li>In most cases, you should consult several references, not just
one.  It is also desirable (although in many cases this won't be
feasible) for you to consult a primary reference or two in addition to
texts.  
</li></ol><p><br>

</p><h3>Possible Project Ideas</h3>

<ul>

<li>Further exploration of the logistic map.  
<ul>
<li>Detailed proof/demonstration of chaos, 
</li><li>Examination of universality
</li><li> Sarkovski's theorem on the ordering of periodic orbits.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Measures of randomness and complexity.  How can we quantify how
random or unpredictable a system is?  How can we quantify how
"complex" or "structured" or "complicated" or "intricate" a system is?  

</li><li> Cellular Automata

</li><li>Develop lesson plans for a high school or elementary class.  Or,
develop materials for the introductory chaos and fractals course to be
taught in the winter.  

</li><li>Fractals
<ul>
<li>Detailed exploration of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.  This could
involve doing some graphical experiments and/or proving some stuff.
</li><li>Applications of fractals in the geosciences.  Looking at the type
of networks formed by river basins might be especially timely, given
that there's a "monster" course in rivers coming up.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Evolution and Adaptation
<ul>
<li>Dynamical models of of evolution.
</li><li>Genetic algorithms.
</li><li>Evolving cellular automata.  (Our book has a section on this.)
</li><li>Population Dynamics.  Effects of finite size populations.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Models of Ecosystems
<ul>
<li>Predator-Prey
</li><li>Agent-based models
</li></ul>

</li><li>Focus on a particular application.  Dynamics arises in tons of
scientific (and unscientific) situations.  

</li><li> Do an experiment.  Collect some data.  Or, work with some data
sets that are publicly available.  Build and analyze a chaotic system.

</li><li>Scaling in biological systems.  Why does metabolism rate depend on
the mass of a creature in the way that it does?

</li><li>Differential Equations.  There are tons of systems that are
modeled via differential equations.
<ul>
<li>Population dynamics
</li><li>Mechanical systems (pendulums and springs and stuff)
</li><li>Chemical reactions
</li></ul>

</li><li>Agent-based simulations

</li><li>Game theory

</li></ul>
